all the genes that are present in a tissue

breast tissue today
3 billion genes total
2000 genes in the readout

if someone had cancer vs no cancer. what is the 

GTEx_network: contains correlated genes and gene groups, which tissue they express in, and the weight of their correlation.
GTEx_module: each gene symbol found in GTEx_network is catalogued here along with its tissue, module, layer.

its still unclear to me what REACTOME is and why the geneIDs are so long but for now we will focus on GTEx_network and GTEx_module.
